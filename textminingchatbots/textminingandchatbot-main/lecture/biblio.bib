The exploration of a richer language like French within the framework of a SLU task implies to recent approaches to handle this difficulty. Since the MEDIA task seems to be one of the most difficult, according several previous studies, we propose to explore Neural Networks approaches focusing of three aspects: firstly, the Neural Network inputs and more specifically the word embeddings; secondly, we compared French version of BERT against the best setup through different ways; Finally, the comparison against State-of-the-Art approaches. Results show that the word embeddings trained on a small corpus need to be updated during SLU model training. Furthermore, the French BERT fine-tuned approaches outperform the classical Neural Network Architectures and achieves state of the art results. However, the contextual embeddings extracted from one of the French BERT approaches achieve comparable results in comparison to word embedding, when integrated into the proposed neural architecture.",

Many approaches have been proposed, often using task-specific architectures with special-purpose classifiers. Recently, good results have been obtained using more general architectures based on pretrained language models. Here, we introduce a new variation of the language modeling approach that uses schema-driven prompting to provide task-aware history encoding that is used for both categorical and non-categorical slots. We further improve performance by augmenting the prompting with schema descriptions, a naturally occurring source of in-domain knowledge. Our purely generative system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MultiWOZ 2.2 and achieves competitive performance on two other benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.1 and M2M.

abstract = {Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a core component of a spoken dialogue system. In the traditional architecture of dialogue systems, the SLU component treats each utterance independent of each other, and then the following components aggregate the multi-turn information in the separate phases. However, there are two challenges: 1) errors from previous turns may be propagated and then degrade the performance of the current turn; 2) knowledge mentioned in the long history may not be carried into the current turn. This paper addresses the above issues by proposing an architecture using end-to-end memory networks to model knowledge carryover in multi-turn conversations, where utterances encoded with intents and slots can be stored as embeddings in the memory and the decoding phase applies an attention model to leverage previously stored semantics for intent prediction and slot tagging simultaneously. The experiments on Microsoft Cortana conversational data show that the proposed memory network architecture can effectively extract salient semantics for modeling knowledge carryover in the multi-turn conversations and outperform the results using the state-of-the-art recurrent neural network framework (RNN) designed for single-turn SLU.},

Applied to spoken language understanding tasks, these models have shown their great potential by improving the state-of-the-art performances on challenging benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present an error analysis reached by the use of such models on the French MEDIA benchmark dataset, known as being one of the most challenging benchmarks for the slot filling task among all the benchmarks accessible to the entire research community. One year ago, the state-of-art system reached a Concept Error Rate (CER) of 13.6{\%} through the use of a end-to-end neural architecture. Some months later, a cascade approach based on the sequential use of a fine-tuned wav2vec2.0 model and a fine-tuned BERT model reaches a CER of 11.2{\%}. This significant improvement raises questions about the type of errors that remain difficult to treat, but also about those that have been corrected using these models pre-trained through self-supervision learning on a large amount of data. This study brings some answers in order to better understand the limits of such models and open new perspectives to continue improving the performance.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proved effective in SF, while there is no prior work using RNNs in ID. Based on the idea that the intent and semantic slots of a sentence are correlative, we propose a joint model for both tasks. Gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to learn the representation of each time step, by which the label of each slot is predicted. Meanwhile, a max-pooling layer is employed to capture global features of a sentence for intent classification. The representations are shared by two tasks and the model is trained by a united loss function. We conduct experiments on two datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both tasks.},

Our approach is based on the premise that a common semantic representation can be extracted from the input for all languages, at least within the context of restricted domains. In our design of such systems, language dependent information is separated from the system kernel as much as possible, and encoded in external data structures. The internal system manager, discourse and dialogue component, and database are all maintained in a language transparent form. Our description will focus on the development of the multilingual MIT Voyager spoken language system, which can engage in verbal dialogues with users about a geographical region within Cambridge, MA in the USA. The system can provide information about distances, travel times or directions between objects located within this area (e.g., restaurants, hotels, banks, libraries), as well as information such as the addresses, telephone numbers or location of the objects themselves. Voyager has been fully ported to Japanese and Italian, and we are in the process of porting to French and German as well. Evaluations for the English, Japanese and Italian systems are reported. Other related multilingual research activities are also briefly mentioned.
Zusammenfassung
Dieser Artikel beschreibt die kürzlich am MIT durchgeführten Arbeiten für die Entwicklung eines multilingualen Mensch-Maschine Dialogsystems. Unser Ansatz geht von der Hypothese aus, daβ — zumindest in einem begrenzten Bereich — eine gemeinsame semantische Repräsentation unabhängig von der Sprache aus einer sprachlichen Äuβerung extrahiert werden kann. In unserer Konzeption eines solchen Systems wird die sprachabhängige Information von dem Kern des Systems so weit wie möglich getrennt und in externen Datenstrukturen kodiert. Der interne Systemmanager, die Gesprächsanalyse- und Dialogmodule und die Datenbänke bleiben unabhängig von der Sprache. Die folgende Beschreibung konzentriert sich auf die Entwicklung des multilingualen oralen Dialogsystems Voyager des MIT, daβ orale Dialoge mit dem Benutzer über die Region von Cambridge, MA, führen kann. Das System kann Information erteilen über die Entfernung, die Fahrzeit oder die Richtungsangaben in den verschiedenen Bezirken (z.B. Restaurants, Hotels, Banken, Buchhandlungen), oder Informationen wie Adressen, Telefonnummern oder die Position der Objekte selbst. Voyager ist bereits vollständig in Japanisch und Italienisch umgesetzt, und wird es in Kürze für Deutsch und Französisch sein. Von den Ergebnissen des Tests zur Bewertung des englischen, japanischen und italienischen Systems wird im weiteren berichtet und andere multilinguale Forschungen zu diesem Thema werden kurz erwähnt.
Résumé
Cet article décrit le travail récent effectué au MIT pour développer des systèmes de dialogue oral homme-machine multilingues. Notre aproche est basée sur l'hypothèse qu'une représentation sémantique commune peut être extraite des énoncés quelle que soit la langue, au moins dans des domaines restreints. Dans notre conception de ces systèmes, l'information dépendante de la langue est séparée le plus possible du noyau du système et encodée dans des structures de données externes. Le gestionnaire interne du système, les modules d'analyse du discours et de dialogue, et les bases de données sont tous maintenues dans un état indépendant de la langue. Dans cet article, nous décrivons plus particulièrement le système de dialoque oral multilingue Voyager qui peut gérer des dialogues concernant la région géographique de Cambridge, MA, aux Etats-Unis. Le système peut fournir des informations concernant les distances, les durées de trajets ou les directions entre des objets situés dans cette zone (par exemple, les restaurants, hotels, banques, bibliothèques, etc.). Il peut également fournir d'autres informations comme des adresses, des numéros de téléphone, ou la position des objets eux-mêmes. Voyager a été entièrement porté en japonais et en italien. Le portage en français et en allemand est en cours. On fournit des résultats d'évaluation des versions en anglais, japonais et italien. D'autres recherches multilingues annexes sont également brièvement mentionnées.}

In practice, these approaches suffer from the drawbacks of domain-driven design and under-resourced languages. Domain and language models are supposed to grow and change as the problem space evolves. On one hand, research on transfer learning has demonstrated the cross-lingual ability of multilingual Transformers-based models to learn semantically rich representations. On the other, in addition to the above approaches, meta-learning have enabled the development of task and language learning algorithms capable of far generalization. Through this context, this article proposes to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of using synergistically few-shot learning with prototypical neural networks and multilingual Transformers-based models. Experiments in natural language understanding tasks on MultiATIS++ corpus shows that our approach substantially improves the observed transfer learning performances between the low and the high resource languages. More generally our approach confirms that the meaningful latent space learned in a given language can be can be generalized to unseen and under-resourced ones using meta-learning.",

    abstract = "End-to-end learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is an attractive solution for dialog systems; however, current techniques are data-intensive and require thousands of dialogs to learn simple behaviors. We introduce Hybrid Code Networks (HCNs), which combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledge encoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existing end-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training data required, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representation of dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both. HCNs attain state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI dialog dataset (Bordes and Weston, 2016), and outperform two commercially deployed customer-facing dialog systems at our company.",

Since these systems typically interact with an external knowledge base that changes over time, it is desirable to incorporate domain knowledge to deal with such changes, yet with minimum human effort. This paper presents an extended version of the Hybrid Code Network (HCN) developed for the Facebook AI research (FAIR) dialog dataset used in the Sixth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC6). Compared to the original HCN, the system was more adaptable to changes in the knowledge base due to the modules that are extended to be learned from data. Using the proposed learning scheme with fairly elementary domain-specific rules, the proposed model achieved 100% accuracy in all test datasets.}

    abstract = "Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) have great commercial potential as they promise to revolutionise the way in which humans interact with machines. The advent of deep learning led to substantial developments in this area of NLP research, and the goal of this tutorial is to familiarise the research community with the recent advances in what some call the most difficult problem in NLP. From a research perspective, the design of spoken dialogue systems provides a number of significant challenges, as these systems depend on: a) solving several difficult NLP and decision-making tasks; and b) combining these into a functional dialogue system pipeline. A key long-term goal of dialogue system research is to enable open-domain systems that can converse about arbitrary topics and assist humans with completing a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, such systems need to autonomously learn on-line to improve their performance and recover from errors using both signals from their environment and from implicit and explicit user feedback. While the design of such systems has traditionally been modular, domain and language-specific, advances in deep learning have alleviated many of the design problems. The main purpose of this tutorial is to encourage dialogue research in the NLP community by providing the research background, a survey of available resources, and giving key insights to application of state-of-the-art SDS methodology into industry-scale conversational AI systems. We plan to introduce researchers to the pipeline framework for modelling goal-oriented dialogue systems, which includes three key components: 1) Language Understanding; 2) Dialogue Management; and 3) Language Generation. The differences between goal-oriented dialogue systems and chat-bot style conversational agents will be explained in order to show the motivation behind the design of both, with the main focus on the pipeline SDS framework. For each key component, we will define the research problem, provide a brief literature review and introduce the current state-of-the-art approaches. Complementary resources (e.g. available datasets and toolkits) will also be discussed. Finally, future work, outstanding challenges, and current industry practices will be presented. All of the presented material will be made available online for future reference.",

The success of traditional template-based or statistical models typically relies on heavily annotated data, which is infeasible for new domains. Therefore, it is pivotal for an NLG system to generalize well with limited labelled data in real applications. To this end, we present FewshotWOZ, the first NLG benchmark to simulate the few-shot learning setting in task-oriented dialog systems. Further, we develop the SC-GPT model. It is pre-trained on a large set of annotated NLG corpus to acquire the controllable generation ability, and fine-tuned with only a few domain-specific labels to adapt to new domains. Experiments on FewshotWOZ and the large Multi-Domain-WOZ datasets show that the proposed SC-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods, measured by various automatic metrics and human evaluations.",

Generative models produce system responses that are autonomously generated word-by-word, opening up the possibility for realistic, flexible interactions. In support of this goal, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder neural network to the dialogue domain, and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and backoff n-gram models. We investigate the limitations of this and similar approaches, and show how its performance can be improved by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.},
